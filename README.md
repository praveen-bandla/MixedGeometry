# MixedGeometry

Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a significant advancement in processing graph-structured data, offering reduced embedding distortion compared to their Euclidean counterparts. Our research focuses on assessing the influence of geometric structures on the performance of three types of GNN for node classification and link prediction tasks. We are evaluating these models in terms of accuracy, stability, and run-time, investigating the variations attributed to geometry and architecture across a range of datasets with varying graph properties. Additionally, our study explores how the selection of geometric space and graph characteristics influences hyperparameter optimization. Currently, a pre-print of our findings has been submitted to the [SoCal NLP Symposium 2023](https://socalnlp.github.io/symp23/index.html), and we are in the process of preparing a comprehensive paper for publication.
